# LaTeX to HTML5 translator using a PEG.js parser

This is a LaTeX to HTML5 translator written in JavaScript using PEG.js.
`latex.js` for LaTeX is similar in spirit to `marked` for Markdown.

LaTeX.js tries to be absolutely and uncompromisingly exact and compatible with LaTeX.
The generated HTML is exactly what is meant to be output, down to the last
space. The CSS makes it look like LaTeX output&mdash;except where impossible in principle,
see limitations.

You can play with it here:

## Installation

```
npm install -g latex.js
```

## Usage

LaTeX.js is divided into a parser and a generator, so that in theory you could switch the
generator to create e.g. plain text instead of HTML. Currently, only a HTML generator exists.

LaTeX.js can parse full LaTeX documents as well as documents without a preamble and only the
text that comes between `\begin{document}` and `\end{document}` in a full LaTeX document. In
that latter case, the default documentclass is used, which is article unless specified otherwise.

The CLI has the following options:

```
Usage: latex.js [options] [files...]

translate a LaTeX document to HTML5


Options:

  -V, --version          output the version number
  -o, --output <file>    specify output file, otherwise STDOUT will be used
  -a, --assets [dir]     copy CSS and fonts to the specified directory, or to the directory of output file
  -b, --bare             don't include HTML boilerplate and CSS, only output the contents of body
  -e, --entities         encode HTML entities in the output instead of using UTF-8 characters
  -p, --pretty           beautify the html (this may add/remove spaces unintentionally)
  -c, --class <class>    set a default documentclass for documents without a preamble (default: article)
  -m, --macros <file>    load a JavaScript file with additional custom macros
  -s, --style <url>      specify an additional style sheet to use (can be repeated)
  -n, --no-hyphenation   don't insert soft hyphens (disables automatic hyphenation in the browser)
  -l, --language <lang>  set hyphenation language (default: en)
  -h, --help             output usage information

If no input files are given, STDIN is read.
```

## Tests

To build it and run the tests, clone this repository and execute:

```
npm run build   # or devbuild
npm test
```

To verify the screenshots (the CSS tests), ImageMagick needs to be installed. Screenshots are taken
with Chromium using `puppeteer`.




## Playground

To build the playground, execute:

```
npm run docs
```


## Architecture

The generated PEG parser parses the LaTeX code. While doing so, it calls appropriate generator functions.
The generator then uses the Macros class to execute the macros that the parser encounters.

Both, the parser and the macros create the resulting HTML DOM tree by calling the HtmlGenerator functions.

The generator also holds the stack, the lengths, counters, fonts, references, etc. It provides some of
TeX's primitives and basic functionality, so to speak.

## Definition of Custom Macros

TODO: write documentation

## Limitations

- I don't create an intermediate AST yet, so TeX's conditional expressions are impossible
- deprecated macros, or macros that are not supposed to be used in LaTeX, won't even exist in LaTeX.js.
  Examples include: eqnarray, the old LaTeX 2.09 font macros \it, \sl, etc. Also missing are most of the plainTeX macros.
  See also [`l2tabuen.pdf`](ftp://ftp.dante.de/tex-archive/info/l2tabu/english/l2tabuen.pdf).
- incorrect but legal markup in LaTeX won't produce the same result in LaTeX.js - like when using \raggedleft in the
  middle of a paragraph; but the LaTeX.js result should be intuitively correct.
- because of the limitations when parsing TeX as a context-free grammar (see [below](#parsing-tex)), native LaTeX packages
  cannot be parsed and loaded. Instead, the macros those packages (and documentclasses) provide have to be implemented in
  JavaScript.


## Limitations of LaTeX.js due to HTML and CSS

The following features in LaTeX just cannot be translated to HTML, not even when using JavaScript:

- TeX removes any whitespace from the beginning and end of a line, even consecutive ones that would be printed in the middle
  of a line, like `\ ` or `~` or ^^0020. This is not possible in HTML (yet - maybe it will be with CSS4).
- horizontal glue, like `\hfill` in a paragraph of text, is not possible
- vertical glue makes no sense in HTML, and is impossible to emulate, except in boxes with fixed height
- `\vspace{}` with a negative value in horizontal mode, i.e. in the middle of a paragraph of text, is not possible
  (but this feature is useless anyway)

And the concept of pages does not really apply to HTML, so any macro related to pagebreaks will be ignored. One
could say that splitting a HTML file into multiple files is like a pagebreak, but then, still, it would be much
easier to handle: just choose a break before a new section or paragraph. There is no absolute space limitation
like on a real page.



## <a name="parsing-tex"></a> Limitations when parsing TeX as a context-free grammar

This is a PEG parser, which means it interprets LaTeX as a context-free language. However, TeX (and therefore LaTeX) is
Turing complete, so TeX can only really be parsed by a complete Turing machine. It is not possible to parse the full
TeX language with a static parser. See
[here](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/4201/is-there-a-bnf-grammar-of-the-tex-language) for some interesting
examples.

It is even undecidable wheather a TeX program has a parse tree. There has been done some research
on the problem of parsing TeX, see [here](http://www.mathematik.uni-marburg.de/~seba/publications/sle10.pdf).

To quote the four problems of TeX:

- Since TeX has dynamic scoping, it is not possible to determine statically
  wheather `a` is an argument to `\app` in `\app a` or just another letter. It depends on the definition of `\app` at
  runtime.

- Macros can be passed as arguments to other macros, further complicating this problem. E.g.:
  ```tex
  \def\app #1 #2 {#1 #2}
  \def\id #1 {#1}
  \app a b
  \app \id c
  ```
  Thus, targets of macro calls can in general not be determined statically.

- TeX has a lexical macro system, which means macro bodies do not have to be syntactically correct pieces
  of TeX code. Also, macros can expand to new macro definitions.

- Tex allows custom macro call syntax. Basically, any syntax could be changed.


I therefore take a slightly different approach:

- First, I don't care about TeX, but only LaTeX, and most LaTeX documents do not use TeX syntax, or `\def` in
  particular. Therefore, this parser assumes standard LaTeX syntax and catcodes.

- Second, for now there is no way of defining macros, only expanding macros is supported. So if a new
  LaTeX macro is needed, reimplement it in JavaScript directly, thus circumventing the problem altogether.


### Expansion and Execution

Additionally, this parser does not implement TeX's distinction of expansion and
execution. I am not yet sure if I need to implement it at all. Right now, there is only one phase that takes a macro
and returns an HTML fragment.

Skipped spaces and macros that expand to a macro taking a parameter further down in the input provide a good
illustration of why TeX makes this distinction. Consider the commands
```tex
\def\a{\penalty200}
\a 0
```
This is not equivalent to
```tex
\penalty200 0
```
which would place a penalty of 200, and typeset the digit 0. Instead, it expands to
```tex
\penalty2000
```
because the space after \a is skipped in the input processor. Later stages of processing then receive the sequence
```tex
\a0
```
However, LaTeX documents themselves usually don't rely on or need this feature--that is, until I'm convinced otherwise.

This also means that you cannot use `\vs^^+ip` to have LaTeX.js interpret it as `\vskip`. Again, this is a feature
that most people will probably never need.


## TODO

* [ ] implement the documentclasses `slides`, `beamer` (using `reveal.js`), and `memoir`
* [ ] implement `\usepackage`; macros in separate classes for each package, then import them
* [ ] implement `newcommand` and `renewcommand`, should be quite easy by now...

Maybe:

* [ ] implement the output using TeX's original linebreaking algorithm: https://github.com/bramstein/typeset



## Alternatives

If you need a LaTeX to HTML translator that also understands TeX to some extent, take a look at

* [LaTeXML](https://github.com/brucemiller/LaTeXML) (Perl) or
* [HEVEA](http://hevea.inria.fr/) (OCaml) or
* [plasTeX](https://github.com/tiarno/plastex) (Python).

There is no such alternative in JavaScript yet, though, which is why I started this project. I want to use it in my
`derby-entities-lib` project.
