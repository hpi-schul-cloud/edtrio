# Overview

[Edtr.io](https://github.com/schul-cloud/edtrio) is a rich text editor for easily creating content in schools based on [Slate.js](https://github.com/ianstormtaylor/slate).

## Getting started

This is a yarn workspaces repository, meaning that we have two subrepositories edtrio-client and edtrio-server. In order to start the client, just navigate to `edtrio-client` and do the following:

```shell
yarn install
yarn start
# go to localhost:3000 if it doesnt open automatically
```

The server is not absolutely necessary at the moment, but if you want persistence of your documents or communication between clients you should start this as well. Navigate to `edtrio-server` and run

```shell
yarn run startFreshDB
yarn run start
# go to localhost:4000 if it doesnt open automatically
```

If you want to know more about this and the underlying technology, please visit the [structure overview](/structure/overview) and the [development guide](/guides/development).

## Development

> ⚠️ Before starting to work on Edtr.io it is **highly recommended** to go trough the [Slate.js Walktroughs and Guides](https://docs.slatejs.org/)
> Beware, though, that the slate docs often are not entirely up to date.

You can learn more about the general structure of Edtr.io in section [1. Structure](/structure). There are a multitude of guides on how to work with the editor in section [2. Guides](/guides). Finally, there is a summary of all plugins in section [3. Plugins](/plugins).

Before starting development please also have a look at our [Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/schul-cloud/edtrio/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) - it's very short, promise! ❤️
