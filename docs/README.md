# Edtr.io [![Docs](https://img.shields.io/badge/docs-Gitbook.io-lightgrey.svg)](https://edtrio.gitbook.io/docs)

Edtr.io is an open-source project created by [Schul-Cloud](https://github.com/schul-cloud) to enable seamless content creation.

It provides two things: A universal editor infrastructure to manipulate and create content and a set of 'lego block' plugins to make that process even easier. Edtr.io is React based and plugins [can be easily created](Develop_plugins.md).<br />Want to contribute?
