# Structure Overview
Edtr.io is heavily based on [Slate.js](https://github.com/ianstormtaylor/slate) and makes great use of its abstractions. Every piece functionality is inside a plugin.

The editor is just one `<Editor />` component inside `Editor.jsx` which itself is made up of many plugins. Plugins can be found inside the [`plugins/` folder](https://github.com/schul-cloud/edtrio/tree/master/src/plugins). More information on the structure of plugins can be found [here](/structure/plugin).

Using Edtr.io one creates documents. Every content created with the editor is a `Document`. A `Document` is simply just a JSON object with a little more rules so that it coheres to a common schema. More information on the Document Schema can be found [here](/structure/document).

Displaying the editor can be easily achieved as such:

```jsx
import Editor from './Editor'


class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div className="App">
        <Editor />
      </div>
    )
  }
}
```
