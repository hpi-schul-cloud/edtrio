# Create a simple plugin

Creating a plugin is actually super simple. In this guide you will create a simple image plugin. The result can be found [here](https://github.com/schul-cloud/edtrio/tree/master/src/plugins/image). Edtr.io plugins are basically just Slate.js plugins. If you already read the [Slate.js Plugin Guide](https://docs.slatejs.org/guides/plugins) - which we **highly** recommend - most things should sound pretty familiar to you.

## 1. Create a folder

To get started the first thing you need to do is create a folder for the plugin you want to create. All Edtr.io plugins are located at `src/plugins`. We create a folder called `image` inside there.

## 2. Main file

As this plugin is fairly small, all code will be inside one file `src/plugins/image/index.js`. Create that file now and put the basic code skeleton below (also see [1. Structure -> Plugin Structure](/structure/plugin) for reference) inside it:

```jsx
// plugins/image/index.js

export default function Image(options) {
    return {
        changes: {
            insertImage,
        },
        helpers: {},
        components: {
            ImageNode,
        },
        plugins: [
            RenderImageNode,
        ],
    }
}

/**
 * Change that inserts an image block displaying the src image
 */
function insertImage(editor, src, target) {...}

/**
 * React Component that displays an actual image from props.src url
 */
function ImageNode(props) {...}

/**
 * Overwrites Slates Editor.renderNode(props) to actually render
 * ImageNode for `img` tags
 */
const RenderImageNode = {...}
```

We are going to implement the code blocks in ll. 39-50 in the following sections.

## 3. Create displaying component

To actually display anything in Slate, we need to create a react component. We'll call our component `<ImageNode ... />` and will implement it as such (in ll. 26f.):

```jsx
function ImageNode(props) {
  const { src, ...attributes } = props;

  return (
    <figure>
      <img src={src} {...attributes} />
    </figure>
  );
}
```

Our `<ImageNode ... />` component basically just takes a `src` as a prop which then replaces the `src` of the enclosed `img` tag and wraps all that inside a `figure` to make it more semantic.

> ⚠️ It is very important to set the `...attributes` to your component as Slate relies on that for internal state management and **will crash** if you don't insert them!

## 4. Inserting an element

To change the underlying document in any way we need call a change function on the provided editor.

```jsx
function insertImage(editor, src, target) {
  if (target) {
    editor.select(target);
  }

  editor.insertBlock({
    type: "img",
    isVoid: true,
    data: { src },
  });
}
```

This snippet simply inserts a block that we named `img` into the document. It also sets the `data.src` attribute of that block to the supplied `src`.

## 5. Rendering custom block

To actually tell the editor what to do when encountering an `img` block, namely to render our `<ImageNode ... />` created in step 3., we need to override the `renderNode()` function supplied by Slate as such:

```jsx
const RenderImageNode = {
  renderNode(props, editor, next) {
    const { attributes, node } = props;

    if (node.type === "img") {
      const src = node.data.get("src");
      return <ImageNode src={src} {...attributes} />;
    }
    return next();
  },
};
```

Our `RenderImageNode` is called whenever a node should be rendered. It checks if the type of the node to be rendered is an `img` and if so renders our custom `<ImageNode ... />`.

If that is not the case `next()` is returned, thus allowing other plugins that override `renderNode()` to render the current node.

## 6. Done

That's it! All it takes to create a custom plugin that renders images is to

1. Create a custom image component
2. Override renderNode
3. Insert a block with the image type somewhere and see slate work it's magic

> **Note**: Our custom `insertImage` function is called inside `plugins/plus-menu/actions.js:onClickImageButton` which is an EventListener on the "Add image" button.
